The error in your Netlify deploy log shows that the configuration file `/opt/build/repo/netlify.toml` has an issue:

**Problem:** There's an unknown character "123" at row 1, column 2, position 1. This typically indicates an invisible character or encoding issue at the very beginning of your `netlify.toml` file.

**Solutions to try:**

1. **Check for BOM (Byte Order Mark):** Your `netlify.toml` file likely has a UTF-8 BOM character at the start. To fix:
   - Open `netlify.toml` in your editor
   - Delete the first line/character
   - Re-type the content from scratch
   - Save as UTF-8 without BOM

2. **Recreate the file:** The safest approach is to:
   - Delete your existing `netlify.toml`
   - Create a new one from scratch
   - Add your configuration

3. **Basic Netlify config for Vite/React:** If you're starting fresh, here's a clean `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

4. **Verify file encoding:** Make sure your editor is set to UTF-8 encoding without BOM when saving the file.

Your `package.json` looks fine - the issue is specifically with the `netlify.toml` configuration file. Once you fix the encoding issue in that file, your deploy should proceed past the initialization stage.
